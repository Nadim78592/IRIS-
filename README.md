IRIS-Flower-Classification:
Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning project designed to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using the renowned Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Description:-
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers. Each sample includes four features:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of three classes:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

iris.csv: The dataset used for this project.
iris_classification.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for:
Data exploration
